            <p>Hi! Welcome to a website I proudly designed.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m working toward a certificate in web development through Rice University which I will earn Monday, October 28, 2024!
                I hope to become a full stack developer and have worked with Node, Express, MongoDB, SQL, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML and
                CSS. In addition, I have worked with JEST for testing and Handlebars, React, Semantic UI and the Bootstrap and Bulma CSS frameworks.</p>

            <p>I work part time as IT for a small church and moderate high school Quiz Bowl tournaments. In my free
                time I enjoy baking, reading, trivia, breaking out of escape rooms, creating puzzles, and spending time
                with my family.</p>
